                                    straight contest on Monday against San Antonio. Whiteside has been dealing with
                                    a
                                    sore knee, though it's at least a good sign that he was initially listed as
                                    questionable. His absence will mean that Richaun Holmes will continue to
                                    dominate
                                    the frontcourt touches for Sacramento, though forwards Chimezie Metu and Chris

                                    could have solid games if they see added minutes. Metu has been earning more

                                    with the coaching staff lately, as he has 13 points, nine rebounds, and three

                                    in his last 30 minutes across two contests.</p>

                                    7-10 days, per Blake Murphy of The Athletic. Lowry was ruled out early for
                                    Wednesday's game, with head coach Nick Nurse saying that the veteran guard's toe
                                    infection \"is not going well.\" With Lowry out for a week, guards Fred VanVleet
                                    and Gary Trent Jr. will shoulder a bigger scoring load in the backcourt. Guard
                                    Rodney Hood and forward Stanley Johnson could also see expanded roles for
                                    Toronto. VanVleet and Trent should be the more reliable DFS plays of the bunch.

                                    Sunday against the Denver Nuggets. Hunter recently returned from a lengthy knee
                                    injury and is experiencing knee soreness, missing the past two games. It is
                                    possible Hunter may have returned too soon which made his knee flare up.
                                    Regardless, Hunter's absence should lead to another start for Tony Snell and
                                    more minutes for Bogdan Bogdanovic, Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. John
                                    Collins is also a big winner here and should be a popular DFS target in this

                                    Kristaps Porzingis (knee) have been ruled out for Saturday's contest against the
                                    Pelicans. Doncic's status was already up-in-the-air due to back tightness, but
                                    he contracted a non-COVD related illness, all but ensuring he wouldn't suit up.
                                    Porzingis will sit for the second half of the team's back-to-back. Jalen
                                    Brunson, Josh Richardson, and Tim Hardaway Jr. should all get a ton of scoring
                                    and playmaking opportunities on Saturday without Doncic and Porzingis. Dwight
                                    Powell and Maxi Kleber should see most of Porzingis' minutes- though Boban
                                    Marjanovic could also make an appearance on the court.
