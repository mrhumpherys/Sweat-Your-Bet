        "Title": "Paul George Ruled Out Tuesday",
        "Content": "Los Angeles Clippers forward Paul  George (foot) has been ruled out for Tuesday's contest against the Magic. It marks George's second straight absence, as he also missed Monday's game against the Bucks due to a sore foot. Forward Marcus  Morris  Sr., guard Reggie  Jackson, and guard Luke  Kennard scored 20-plus points with at least four triples without George in the picture against Milwaukee. The Magic have been very generous to wing players this year, so all three are in play for DFS formats, as well as Kawhi  Leonard.",
