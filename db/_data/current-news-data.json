        "Content": "Toronto Raptors guard Kyle  Lowry (foot) will be sidelined for 7-10 days, per Blake Murphy of The Athletic. Lowry was ruled out early for Wednesday's game, with head coach Nick Nurse saying that the veteran guard's toe infection \"is not going well.\" With Lowry out for a week, guards Fred  VanVleet and Gary  Trent  Jr. will shoulder a bigger scoring load in the backcourt. Guard Rodney  Hood and forward Stanley  Johnson could also see expanded roles for Toronto. VanVleet and Trent should be the more reliable DFS plays of the bunch.",

It marks George's second straight absence, as he also missed Monday's game against the Bucks due to a sore foot. Forward Marcus  Morris  Sr., guard Reggie  Jackson, and guard Luke  Kennard scored 20-plus points with at least four triples without George in the picture against Milwaukee. The Magic have been very generous to wing players this year, so all three are in play for DFS formats, as well as Kawhi  Leonard.",

Whiteside has been dealing with a sore knee, though it's at least a good sign that he was initially listed as questionable. His absence will mean that Richaun  Holmes will continue to dominate the frontcourt touches for Sacramento, though forwards Chimezie  Metu and Chris  Silva could have solid games if they see added minutes. Metu has been earning more trust with the coaching staff lately, as he has 13 points, nine rebounds, and three blocks in his last 30 minutes across two contests.",

Hunter recently returned from a lengthy knee injury and is experiencing knee soreness, missing the past two games. It is possible Hunter may have returned too soon which made his knee flare up. Regardless, Hunter's absence should lead to another start for Tony  Snell and more minutes for Bogdan  Bogdanovic, Danilo  Gallinari and Kevin  Huerter. John  Collins is also a big winner here and should be a popular DFS target in this one.",

Doncic's status was already up-in-the-air due to back tightness, but he contracted a non-COVD related illness, all but ensuring he wouldn't suit up. Porzingis will sit for the second half of the team's back-to-back. Jalen  Brunson, Josh  Richardson, and Tim  Hardaway  Jr. should all get a ton of scoring and playmaking opportunities on Saturday without Doncic and Porzingis. Dwight  Powell and Maxi  Kleber should see most of Porzingis' minutes- though Boban  Marjanovic could also make an appearance on the court.",

Doncic is dealing with lower back tightness, an issue that reportedly first popped up in mid-February. While he'll miss Friday's game, head coach Rick Carlisle said that the star guard is getting treatment and will travel with the team to New Orleans for Saturday's game against the Pelicans. Doncic's absence will mean extra scoring and playmaking opportunities for Jalen  Brunson, who immediately becomes an appealing DFS play. Trey  Burke could also see added playmaking chances, with Kristaps  Porzingis and Tim  Hardaway  Jr. perhaps seeing a few extra looks go their way on offense as well.",

Forward Nicolo  Melli accompanies Redick in the deal to Dallas. The 36-year-old Redick will provide shooting off the bench and take some opportunities away from Dorian  Finney-Smith and Jalen  Brunson, though the latter should remain the best player off of Dallas' bench. The veteran sharpshooter likely won't have a very lucrative role, but he could be a matchup-based play in DFS formats.",
